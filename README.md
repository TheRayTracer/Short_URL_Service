# Short URL Service
This repository houses a simple proof-of-concept python web service that uses Flask and connects to a serverless cloud hosted SQL Server database in Azure. The web service implements a very basic URL shortener. This is designed for educational purposes, and NOT designed for any production nor commercial use.

## Future
- Store database usernames, and passwords in an Azure Key Vault.
